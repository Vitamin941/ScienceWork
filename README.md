# Scientific-Work
  This is student's scientific work. (The Third course - Bachelor dergees). I am studing at the Irkutsk State University (ISU) at a faculty of mathematics.
The work is called **"Control of a material point moving in a vertical plane under the action of a reactive force and gravity with undivided multipoint intermediate conditions"**. At the first I start with mathematical solution of this work. Now want to automate solve. 
You can find my presentations in the folder called "Presentation"
