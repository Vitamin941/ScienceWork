# Scientific-Work
  This is student's scientific work. (Second course (now 3-rd) - Bachelor dergees). I am studing at the Irkutsk State University (ISU) at a faculty of mathematics.
The work is called "Control of a material point moving in a vertical plane under the action of a reactive force and gravity with undivided multipoint intermediate conditions". At the first I start with mathematical
solution of this work. Now want to automate solve. 


Technologies use:

  Python 3.8 and a libraries (Sympy, numpy and PyQT5).
  
  And sole tools like Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.
  
Steps:
  Code a basic GUI with PyQT5 - (done)
  Code a solution of a task - (in progress)
  Code a plotting utility
   
Conferences I've been to (with this work):
  2021:
    ISU conference (participant): Irkutsk at the Irkutsk State University
    ESI conferenct (participant): Irkutsk at the L. A. Melentyev Institute of Energy Systems
